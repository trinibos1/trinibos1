Hey, I’m **@trinibos1** 👋

I’m a hardware-focused maker who loves mechanical keyboards, clean engineering, and anything you can build, solder, or bolt together. I’m big on custom keyboards and macropads, and I’m diving deep into PCB design, electronics, and firmware that brings hardware to life.

### 🔧 What I’m Doing

* Learning PCB design and hardware engineering
* Building custom keyboard/macropad hardware (and the firmware to drive it)
* Open to collaborating on hardware-heavy or keyboard-related open-source projects
